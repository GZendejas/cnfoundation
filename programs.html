To date, the porgram has funded several parks in San Jose, Oakland, and San Leandro. Our goal is to provide children with a healthy outlet in high crime neighborhoods.</p>
                        <p class="skate-section__paragraph">Aside from the initial funding, WE-SKATE also oversees planning and construction of the parks. We work closely with city officials throughout the Bay Area to minimize project time. We also work with law enforcement to ensure safety and frequent patrols during park hours.</p>

Our aim is to introduce students to the great outdoors trough hiking. It's an easy way to keep students physically active, while introducing them to new sorroundings.</p>
                        <p class="hike-section__paragraph">We organize hiking trips for students during the spring and summer. The program starts with easy hiking trails, and gradually progresses to more difficult trails throughout the length of the program. We also work with county parks departments to provide the students with guided informational tours, allowing them to learn about wild animals and plants a few miles from their own communities.</p>
